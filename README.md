# Theories and Mechanisms for AI-Powered ESL Speaking System Design

**A Scoping Review of 17 Empirical Studies (2015-2025)**

This repository hosts the research findings and interactive visualization for a systematic scoping review that maps the evidence-based foundations for designing AI-powered speaking practice systems for adult English as a Second Language (ESL) learners.

## Research Overview

The rapid integration of AI into language learning has outpaced pedagogical validation. This project addresses that gap by synthesizing recent empirical evidence to answer two core questions:
1.  **Theories:** What learning theories support AI-powered speaking practice?
2.  **Mechanisms:** Which instructional mechanisms effectively improve speaking outcomes?

### Key Findings

#### 🧠 6 Foundational Learning Theories
The review identifies six theories that justify specific design choices in AI systems:
1.  **Skill Acquisition Theory:** Progression from declarative knowledge to procedural automaticity through practice.
2.  **The Noticing Hypothesis:** The critical role of feedback in helping learners consciously "notice" gaps in their interlanguage.
3.  **Transfer-Appropriate Processing:** Practice must resemble the cognitive processes of real-world performance (e.g., timed, impromptu).
4.  **Usage-Based Constructionist Theory:** Language learning as the entrenchment of form-meaning pairings (constructions) through frequency.
5.  **Sociocultural Theory:** The role of AI as a "More Knowledgeable Other" to scaffold performance and lower anxiety.
6.  **Retrieval Practice:** The benefits of spaced repetition and "desirable difficulties" for long-term retention.

#### ⚙️ 10 Instructional Mechanisms
Evidence points to ten specific mechanisms that drive learning gains:
*   **Feedback:** Explicit ASR (speech recognition) feedback outperforms generic prompts; "Pending" feedback (delaying correction) promotes self-repair.
*   **Scheduling:** Adaptive spacing (adjusting intervals based on performance) and Phased Practice (moving from blocked to interleaved tasks).
*   **Scaffolding:** Structural frameworks (like BOPPPS) and partner scaffolding (using AI or peers) to manage cognitive load.

#### 🎯 Design Applications
The research proposes a "Theory-Mechanism-Design" (TMD) logic to guide the development of business-ready AI-ESL solutions, focusing on:
*   **Progression Engines:** Architecting the practice curve from accuracy to fluency.
*   **Metacognition:** Tools that turn learners into problem-solvers (e.g., visualization dashboards).
*   **Hybrid Feedback:** Combining micro-level (pronunciation) and macro-level (discourse) feedback.
